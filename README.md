# Uberish

Just cause I've heard a lot of "Let's build me an app like uber that will disrupt the market and give Uber a run for their money".

Just set this project up and build out the remaining unicorn features and good luck to you as you "Disrupt the market with yet another Uberish app" ðŸš€ðŸš€

## What can you do with this app at the moment?

- Get user's current location.
- Use the Google Directions to suggest adresses while the user is typing in the search box.
- View a drawn path to the destination.
- Calculate the estimated value of the ride.

## Requirements

- You need to put a Google Maps API key in a `config.js` file in the `src` folder. Example: 

```
const config = {
    maps_api_key: 'your_api_key'
}
export default config;

```
